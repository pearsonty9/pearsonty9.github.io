        &emsp;This page describes some of the personal projects that I have completed and some that I am currently working on. All of these projects can be seen on my github page.
        <br><br>&emsp;For each project I describe the purpose of the project, what it attempts to solve, and why I am working on it.

      <h1>Todo List</h1>
      <p>
        Goal: This application is intended to be than just a notepad. I plan for it to include the sorting of tasks into different folders or groups. It will allow you to order the tasks by their different properties. As well as give you reminders and notifications of when tasks need to be completed. 
        <br><br>Purpose: I created this app initially to work on and use the skills I have learned from many of my classes. In the app I use different algorithms and programming techniques that I was taught. I have also gone on to use this application as a way to practice application developement. I taken a more serious approach in order to this to properly model application developemt. 
        <br><br>Language: protyped in C (currently on github), actual application will be in C#
        <br><br>Progress: Active project

      <h1>Meal Tracker</h1>
      <p>
        Goal: I intend for this application to allow the user to keep track of meals and recipies as well as create a weekly plan for what they plan to eat. I would like if I could then create a list of all the ingredients needed for that week's meals.
        <br><br>Purpose: Ever since moving away from home and having to keep track of what I am going to be eating everyday, I have wanted something that can tell me everything I would need to buy for the week. So I thought of this app that would tell me exactly what I need to buy at the start of every week.

      <h1>Time Tracker</h1>
      <p>
        Goal: This application is intended to be than just a notepad. I plan for it to include the sorting of tasks into different folders or groups. It will allow you to order the tasks by their different properties. As well as give you reminders and notifications of when tasks need to be completed. 
        <br><br>Purpose: After gainning the freedom that going to college has provided me I have realised that I would like a way to look back on how I have spent my time over the past day, week, or even year. What some people do to solve this is start timers that keep track of the time they spend doing different tasks. This can help to increase productivity as well as keep a record of what you have been doing so that you keep yourself accountable for the time you spend. So I wanted to create my own program that I could customize to my needs.

    <div class="home-block">
      <h1>Livability</h1>
      <p>
        Goal: This program uses the google maps API in order to create a rating system of the how livable a selected point is. The rating system is based on the distance and amount of different green spaces and utlities around the selected location such as fire stations, hospitals, and parks.
        <br><br>Purpose: This project was my team's and I's submission to the 2020 KnightHacks Hack-a-thon. We took the combined backgrounds and knowledge base of each of our team members in order to com up with an idea that we could all contribute to. As one of our team members knows a lot about sustainability they came up with the idea of a rating system using google maps to determine what utilities are around a selected location.
