                This project originally started out as a class project. It started out as a group of 7 people for the project all working on different aspects. After the class eneded a couple of wanted to continue development on this project and see where we could talk it. That leads us to today.

                Nominate is a mobile app designed to provide you and your friends a way of deciding on where to go when nobody wants to decide. We let a group of friends signup and join a group together where they will all be shown a list of restaurants in their area and be able to match or pass and based on everyones decision we will decide a place to eat for the group
